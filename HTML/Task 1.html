    <h1> Introduction </h1>
    <p>
        Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.
        Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, 
        make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting 
        or glue language to connect existing components together.
        Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance.
        Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse.
        The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or 
        binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.
        <br>
        Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides.
        Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast.
        Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault.
        Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception.
        When the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. 
        A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, 
        setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on.
        The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python's introspective power.
        On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print
        statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach 
        very effective.

    <h2>Description </h2>
    <p>
        Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural,
        object-oriented, and functional programming. It comes with a large standard
        library that provides built-in modules and functions for tasks such as file handling,
        mathematical operations, web development, and data manipulation. Python is
        platform-independent, which means the same code can run on different operating
        systems such as Windows, Linux, and macOS without modification.
        <br><br>
        Python is widely used in many fields such as web development, data science,
        artificial intelligence, machine learning, automation, and scientific computing.
        Popular frameworks like Django and Flask are used for web development, while
        libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib are used for data analysis and
        visualization. Because of its versatility, strong community support, and extensive
        documentation, Python has become one of the most popular programming languages
        in the world.
